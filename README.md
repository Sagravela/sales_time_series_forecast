## ~4000 Time Series Analysis and Forecasting wiht R
### This repository contains code and resources for forecasting sales using R. Sales forecasting is a critical task for businesses to predict future sales and make informed decisions about inventory, staffing and marketing strategies.

### Workflow Overview
- **Data Preparation**: Includes cleaning, transforming, and structuring the raw sales dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights into the data, addressing promotional effects, outliers and features summary.
- **Model Validation**: Uses a sub-dataset to validate and select the best forecasting models.
- **Model Fitting and Forecasting**: Applies the chosen models to the entire dataset to generate forecasts.
- **Results Storage**: Saves all predictions in a comprehensive and lightweight Parquet format for easy access and analysis.

### Shiny App Features
- **Interactive Interface**: Allows end users to search for specific stores and products.
- **Predictions Display**: Provides well-curated sales predictions for the selected store and product.
- **Residual Analysis**: Offers insights into the model performance through residual analysis.
- **Feature Correlation**: Displays correlations between features and sales, aiding in understanding the factors influencing sales.

### Getting Started
Shiny App can be run without any setup, click on [shinyapp.io](https://sagravela.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/). To reproduce the results locally, clone the repository and create an environment from the `environment.yml` file with `conda create -f environment.yml`, then make a `model/` folder in the workspace root to save the trained models. Finally, run each script in order.
